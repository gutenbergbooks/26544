<h2>THE DANCE FESTIVALS OF THE ALASKAN ESKIMO</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE DANCE IN GENERAL</strong></p>


<p>The ceremonial dance of the Alaskan Eskimo is a rhythmic
pantomime&mdash;the story in gesture and song of the lives of the
various Arctic animals on which they subsist and from whom they
believe their ancient clans are sprung. The dances vary in
complexity from the ordinary social dance, in which all share
promiscuously and in which individual action is subordinated
to rhythm, to the pantomime totem dances performed by
especially trained actors who hold their positions from year to
year according to artistic
merit.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Yet even in the totem dances
the pantomime is subordinate to the rhythm, or rather superimposed
upon it, so that never a gesture or step of the characteristic
native time is lost.</p>

<p>This is a primitive 2-4 beat based on the double roll of the
chorus of drums. Time is kept, in the men&#8217;s dances, by stamping
the foot and jerking the arm in unison, twice on the right, then
twice on the left side, and so on, alternately. Vigorous dancers
vary the program by leaping and jumping at intervals, and the
shamans are noted for the dizzy circles which they run
round the p&uacute;gyarok, the entrance hole of the dance hall. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
women&#8217;s dance has the same measure and can be performed
separately or in conjunction with the men&#8217;s dance, but has a
different and distinctly feminine movement. The feet are kept
on the ground, while the body sways back and forth in graceful
undulations to the music and the hands with outspread palms
part the air with the graceful stroke of a flying gull. Some of
their dances are performed seated. Then they strip to the waist
and form one long line of waving arms and swaying shoulders,
all moving in perfect unison.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Chorus</span></p>

<p>The chorus which furnishes the music, is composed of from
six to ten men. They sit on the ing&#769;lak, a raised shelf extending
around the dance hall about five feet from the floor, and sing
their dance songs keeping time on their drums. They usually
sit in the rear of the room, which is the post of honor. Among
the island tribes of Bering Strait this position is reversed and
they occupy the front of the room. Some old man, the keeper
of tribal tradition and song, acts as the leader, calling out
the words of the dance songs a line ahead. He begins the
proceedings by striking up a low chant, an invitation to the
people assembled to dance. The chorus accompany him lightly
on their drums. Then at the proper place, he strikes a crashing
double beat; the drums boom out in answer; the song arises
high and shrill; the dancers leap into their places, and the dance
begins.</p>

<p>The first dances are usually simple exercises calculated to
warm the blood and stretch stiffened muscles. They begin with
leaping around the p&uacute;g&#769;yarok, jumping into the air with both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
feet in the Eskimo high kick, settling down into the conventional
movements of the men&#8217;s
dance.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<p>Quite often a woman steps into the center of the circle,
and goes through her own dance, while the men leap and dance
around her. This act has been specialized in the Reindeer and
Wolf Pack Dance of the Aith&uacute;kaguk, the Inviting-In Festival,
where the woman wearing a reindeer crest and belt is surrounded
by the men dancers, girt in armlets and fillets of wolf skin. They
imitate the pack pulling down a deer, and the din caused by their
jumping and howling around her shrinking form is terrific.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Participation of the Sexes</span></p>

<p>There appears to be no restriction against the women
taking part in the men&#8217;s dances. They also act as assistants to
the chief actors in the Totem Dances, three particularly expert
and richly dressed women dancers ranging themselves behind
the mask dancer as a pleasing background of streaming furs and
glistening feathers. The only time they are forbidden to enter
the k&aacute;sgi is when the shaman is performing certain secret rites.
They also have secret meetings of their own when all men are
banished.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
I happened to stumble on to one of these one time
when they were performing certain rites over a pregnant woman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
but being a white man, and therefore unaccountable, I was
greeted with a good-natured laugh and sent about my business.</p>

<p>On the other hand, men are never allowed to take part in the
strictly women&#8217;s dances, although nothing pleases an Eskimo
crowd more than an exaggerated imitation by one of their clowns
of the movements of the women&#8217;s dance. The women&#8217;s dances
are practiced during the early winter and given at the Aiy&aacute;guk,
or Asking Festival, when the men are invited to attend as spectators.
They result in offers of temporary marriage to the
unmarried women, which is obviously the reason for this rite.
Such dances, confined to the women, have not been observed in
Alaska outside the islands of Bering Sea, and I have reason to
believe are peculiar to this district, which, on account of its
isolation, retains the old forms which have died out or been
modified on the mainland. But throughout Alaska the women
are allowed the utmost freedom in participating in the festivals,
either as naskuks<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
or feast givers, as participants or as spectators.</p>

<p>In fact, the social position of the Eskimo woman has been
misrepresented and misunderstood. At first sight she appears
to be the slave of her husband, but a better acquaintance will
reveal the fact that she is the manager of the household and the
children, the business partner in all his trades, and often the
&ldquo;oom&iacute;alik,&rdquo; or captain of the concern as well. Her husband
is forbidden by tribal custom to maltreat her, and if she owns
the house, she can order him out at any time. I have never
known a woman being head of a tribe, but sometimes a woman
is the most influential member of a tribe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE K&Aacute;SGI OR DANCE HOUSE</h2>


<p>With few exceptions, all dances take place in the village
k&aacute;sgi or dance hall. This is the public meeting place where the
old men gather to sit and smoke while they discuss the village
welfare, where the married men bring their work and take their
sweat baths, and where the bachelors and young men, termed k&aacute;sgimiut,
have their sleeping quarters. The k&aacute;sgi is built and
maintained at public expense, each villager considering it an
honor to contribute something. Any tools or furnishings brought
into the k&aacute;sgi are considered public property, and used as such.</p>

<p>When a k&aacute;sgi is to be built, announcement is made through
messengers to neighboring villages, and all gather to assist in
the building and to help celebrate the event. First a trench
several feet deep is dug in which to plant the timbers forming the
sides. These are usually of driftwood, which is brought by the
ocean currents from the Yukon. The ice breaks up first at the
head of that great stream, and the d&eacute;bris dams up the river,
which overflows its banks, tearing down trees, buildings and
whatever borders its course as it breaks its way out to the
sea. The wreckage is scattered along the coast for over a
hundred miles, and the islands of Bering Sea get a small share.
The islanders are constantly on the lookout for the drifting
timber, and put out to sea in the stormiest weather for a distant
piece, be it large or small. They also patrol the coast after a
high tide for stray bits of wood. When one considers the toil
and pain with which material is gathered, the building of a
k&aacute;sgi becomes an important matter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
After the timbers have been rough hewn with the adze
(&uacute;limon) they are set upright in the trench to a height of seven
to eight feet and firmly bedded with rock. This is to prevent
the fierce Polar winds which prevail in midwinter from tearing
the houses to pieces. In the older buildings a protecting stone
wall was built on the sides. Most of the houses are set in a side
hill, or partly underground, for additional security, as well as
for warmth. The roof is laid on top of the uprights, the logs
being drawn in gradually in pyramid shape to a flat top. In the
middle of the top is the &#7769;&aacute;lok or smoke hole, an opening about
two feet square. In a k&aacute;sgi thirty feet square the r&aacute;lok is
twenty feet above the floor. It is covered with a translucent
curtain of walrus gut. The dead are always taken out through
this opening, and never by the entrance. The most important
feature of the room is the ing&#769;lak, a wide shelf supported by posts
at intervals. It stands about five feet high extending around the
room. This serves the double purpose of a seat and bed for
the inmates of the k&aacute;sgi. The rear, the k&aacute;an, is the most
desirable position, being the warmest, and is given to headmen
and honored guests.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The side portions, k&aacute;aklim, are given to
the lesser lights and the women and children; and the front,
the &oacute;aklim, being nearest the entrance and therefore cold and
uncomfortable is left for the orphans and worthless men.</p>

<p>The floor of the k&aacute;sgi is made of rough planking, and the
boards in the center are left loose so that they may be easily
removed. These cover the k&#275;n&eacute;thluk or fireplace, an excavation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
four feet square, and four feet deep, used in the sweat baths.
It is thought to be the place where the spirits sit, when they
visit the k&aacute;sgi, during festivals held in their honor. Offerings
are poured to them through the cracks in the planks. In the
center of the floor is a round hole about two feet in diameter,
called the entrance hole or p&uacute;gyarok. This connects with a
long tunnel, the ag&#769;veak, which leads outside. The tunnel is
usually so low that it is necessary to enter in a stooping position,
which the Eskimo does by placing both hands on the sides of
the p&uacute;gyarok, and drawing himself through. Some dance-houses
have another entrance directly into the room on a level
with the ground, the underground passage being used only in
winter. The diagram (<a href="#Page_42">Plate XI</a>) gives an idea of this arrangement.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Paraphernalia</span></p>

<p>The drum (sa&uacute;yit)<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
is the only instrument employed in the
dances. It is made of a circular hoop about eighteen inches in
width over which is stretched a resonant covering made from
the bladder of the walrus or seal. It is held in place by a cord
of rawhide (ok&#769;linok)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
which fits into a groove on the outer rim.
The cover can therefore be tightened at will. It is customary
during the intermissions between the dances for the drummers
to rub a handful of snow over the skins to prevent them from
cracking under the heavy blows. The drum is held aloft and
struck with a thin stick (m&uacute;mwa).<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
It gives a deep boom in
answer. The shaman uses a smaller baton with which he beats
a continuous tattoo as an accompaniment to his songs. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
northerners strike the back of the rim with their sticks, while
the Yukon people belabor the face of the drum.</p>

<p>The leader of the chorus frequently flourishes a baton, made
from a fox tail or the skin of the ermine which is mounted on a
stick. With this he marks the time of the dance. In <a href="#Page_52">Plate XIV</a>,
the white blur is the ermine at the end of his stick. It is very
difficult to obtain a good picture in the ill lighted k&aacute;sgi, and not
often that the natives will allow one taken there.</p>

<p>One indispensable part of a male dancer&#8217;s outfit is his
gloves. I have never seen a man dancing without them.
These are usually of wolverine, or of reindeer with elaborate
trimmings, but on ordinary occasions any kind will do. The
women do not share this peculiarity. In place of gloves they
wear handlets of grass decorated with feathers of duck or of
ptarmigan. The men in the Totem Dances also wear handlets
which are carved and painted to represent the particular totem
they seek to honor. These too are fantastically decorated with
feathers, usually of the loon. The central feather is stripped,
and crowned with a tuft of white down. Both men and women
wear armlets and fillets of skin or feathers according to the
animal character they represent. When in the full swing of the
dance with fur and feathers streaming they present a pleasing
spectacle, a picture full of the same wild grace and poetic motion
which characterizes the animal forbears from which they claim
descent.</p>

<p>The chief characters in the Totem and Comic Dances wear
masks and carry staves decorated with feathers. Occasionally
the women assistants carry feathered wands (Kel&iacute;zruk).</p>

<p>Of the masks there is a great variety ranging from the plain
wooden masks to those of such great size that they are suspended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
from the ceiling of the k&aacute;sgi by a cord while the dancer performs
behind them.</p>

<p>The Cape Prince of Wales (Kin&iacute;gumiut) Eskimo construct
complete figures of their totems. These are worked by means of
concealed strings by the performers, a climax of art which is
supposed to be particularly pleasing to the spirits addressed.
Then the shaman
(T&uacute;ngalik)<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
has his own set of masks, hideous
enough to strike terror to even the initiated. Each one of these
represents a familiar spirit
(t&uacute;nghat)<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
which assists him in his operations.</p>

<p>Ordinary dance masks may be made by anyone, but the
masks for the ceremonial dances are made by some renowned
shaman, engaged for the occasion. These masks are burned at
the close of the festival, but may be sold by the actors if they
supply an equal amount of wood for the sacrificial fire.</p>

<p>Many of the masks are very complicated, having appendages
of wood, fur and feathers. They are all fashioned with an
idea of representing some feature in the mythology of the spirit
(Inua) or animal shade (Tunghat) which they represent. In
the latter case they are nearly always made double, the mythical
beings who inhabited the early world being regarded as able to
change from animal to human shape, by merely pushing up or
pulling down the upper part of the face as a mask. Such masks
are often hinged to complete the illusion, the actor changing the
face at will.</p>

<p>It might be mentioned here that when the actor puts on the
mask he is supposed to become imbued with the spirit of the
being represented. This accounts, to the native mind, for the
very lifelike imitation which he gives.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
The masks are painted along conventional lines; the favorite
colors for the inua masks are red
(Kar&eacute;kteoak),<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
black (Auktoak), green (C&uacute;ngokyoak), white (Kat&eacute;ktoak), and blue
(Ta&uacute;krektoak), in the order named. These
colors<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
may hold a sacred or symbolic significance. The inua masks are decorated with
some regard to the natural colors of the human face, but in the
masks of the t&uacute;nghat the imagination of the artist runs riot.
The same is true of the comic masks, which are rendered as
grotesque and horrible as possible. A mask with distorted
features, a pale green complexion, surrounded by a bristling mass
of hair, amuses them greatly. The Eskimo also caricature their
neighbors, the D&egrave;n&egrave;, in this same manner, representing them by
masks with very large noses and sullen features.</p>

<h2>THE DANCE FESTIVALS</h2>


<p>The Dance Festivals of the Alaskan Eskimo are held during
that cold, stormy period of the winter when the work of the year
is over and hunting is temporarily at an end. At this season
the people gather in the k&aacute;sgi to celebrate the local rites, and at
certain intervals invite neighboring tribes to join in the great
inter-tribal festivals. This season of mirth and song is termed
&ldquo;Tcauy&aacute;vik&rdquo; the drum dance season, from &ldquo;Tca&uacute;yak&rdquo; meaning
drum. It lasts from November to March, and is a continuous
succession of feasts and dances, which makes glad the heart of
the Eskimo and serves to lighten the natural depression caused
by day after day of interminable wind and darkness. A brisk
exchange of presents at the local festivals promotes good feeling,
and an interchange of commodities between the tribes at the
great feasts stimulates trade and results in each being supplied
with the necessities of life. For instance, northern tribes
visiting the south bring presents of reindeer skins or m&uacute;kluk
to eke out the scanty supply of the south, while the latter in
return give their visitors loads of dried salmon which the
northerners feed to their dogs.</p>

<p>The festivals also serve to keep alive the religious feeling
of the people, as evidenced in the Dance to the Dead, which
allows free play to the nobler sentiments of filial faith and
paternal love. The recital of the deeds of ancient heroes preserves
the best traditions of the race and inspires the younger
generation. To my mind, there is nothing which civilization
can supply which can take the place of the healthy exercise,
social enjoyment, commercial advantages, and spiritual uplift
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of these dances. Where missionary sentiment is overwhelming
they are gradually being abandoned; where there is a mistaken
opinion in regard to their use, they have been given up altogether;
but the tenacity with which the Eskimo clings to these ancient
observances, even in places where they have been nominal
christians for years, is an evidence of the vitality of these ancient
rites and their adaptation to the native mind.</p>

<p>The festivals vary considerably according to locality, but
their essential features are the same. Taken in order of celebration
they are as follows</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">Local Festivals.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 1. <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Aiy&aacute;guk or Asking Festival.</span><br />

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">Inter-tribal Festivals.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 4. <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The A&iacute;thuk&#257;&#769;tukhtuk or Great Feast to the Dead.</span><br />
 5. <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Aith&uacute;kaguk or Inviting-In Feast.</span></p>

<p>The Asking Festival, which begins the round of feasting
and dancing, takes place during the November moon. It is a
local ceremony in which gifts are exchanged between the men
and women of the village, which result in offers of temporary
marriage. It takes its name from the Aiy&aacute;guk or Asking
Stick,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
which is the wand of office of the messenger or go-between.
The Annual Feast to the Dead is held during the December moon,
and may be repeated again in spring after the Bladder Feast,
if a large number of Eskimos have died in the interim. It consists
of songs and dances accompanied by offerings of food and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
drink to the dead. It is a temporary arrangement for keeping the
dead supplied with sustenance (they are thought to imbibe the
spiritual essence of the offerings) until the great Feast to the
Dead takes place.</p>

<p>This is held whenever the relatives of the deceased have
accumulated sufficient food, skins and other goods to entertain
the countryside and are able to properly honor the deceased.
At the same time the namesakes of the dead are richly clothed
from head to foot and showered with presents. As this prodigal
generosity entails the savings of years on the part of the feast
givers (n&aacute;skut), the feast occurs only at irregular intervals of
several years. It has been termed the Ten Year Feast by the
traders (K&aacute;gruska), but so far as I have been able to inquire,
it has no fixed date among the Eskimo. It is by far the most
important event in the life of the Alaskan native. By it he discharges
all debts of honor to the dead, past, present and future.
He is not obliged to take part in another festival of the kind unless
another near relative dies. He pays off all old scores of hospitality
and lays his friends under future obligations by his
presents. He is often beggared by this prodigality, but he can
be sure of welcome and entertainment wherever he goes, for he
is a man who has discharged all his debts to society and is
therefore deserving of honor for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>In the Bladder Feast which takes place in January, the
bladders of the animals slain during the past season, in which
the spirits of the animals are supposed to reside, are returned
to the sea, after appropriate ceremonies in the k&aacute;sgi. There
they are thought to attract others of their kind and bring an
increase to the village. This is essentially a coast festival.
Among the tribes of the islands of Bering Sea and the Siberian
Coast this festival is repeated in March, in conjunction with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
whaling ceremony performed at the taking down of the
&#363;miaks.</p>

<p>The dance contests in the Inviting-In Feast resemble the nith
songs of Greenland. They are Comic and Totem Dances in
which the best performers of several tribes contest singly or in
groups for supremacy. The costumes worn are remarkably fine
and the acting very realistic. This is essentially a southern festival
for it gives an opportunity to the Eskimo living near the
rivers to display their ingenious talent for mimicry and for the
arrangement of feathers.</p>

<p>There are a few purely local ceremonies, the outgrowth of
practices of local shamans. An example of this is the Aitek&aacute;tah
or Doll Festival of the Igomiut, which has also spread to the
neighboring D&egrave;n&egrave;. Such local outgrowths, however, do not
appear to spread among the conservative Eskimo, who resent
the least infringement of the ancient practices handed down from
dim ancestors of the race.</p>

<p>It is not often that they will allow a white man to witness
the festival dances, but, owing to the friendliness of the chief of
the Diomede tribes, who always reserved a seat for me next to
him in the k&aacute;sgi, I had the opportunity of seeing the local rites
and the Great Dance to the Dead. The same favor continuing
with the chief of the Unalit, during my residence on the Yukon,
I witnessed the Inviting-In Feast as celebrated by the southern
tribes. Having described the dances in general, I will proceed
to a detailed account of each.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Asking Festival</span></p>

<p>The Aiy&aacute;guk or Asking Festival is the first of the local
feasts. It occurs about the middle of November when the
Eskimo have all returned from their summer travels and made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
their iglus secure against the storms of the coming winter.
So, with caches full of fish, and houses packed with trade goods
after a successful season at the southern camps, they must
wait until the shifting ice pack settles and the winter hunting
begins. Such enforced inaction is irksome to the Eskimo, who
does not partake of the stolidity of the Indian, but like a nervous
child must be continually employed or amused. So this festival,
which is of a purely social character, has grown up.</p>

<p>My first intimation that there was a celebration taking place
was being attracted by a tremendous uproar in the native village
just as darkness had fallen. Suspecting that the Eskimo were
making merry over a native brew, called
&ldquo;hoosch,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
I slipped down
to the village to see what was the matter. I was met by the
queerest procession I have ever seen. A long line of men and
boys, entirely naked and daubed over with dots and figures of
mingled oil and
charcoal,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
were proceeding from house to house
with bowls in their hands. At each entrance they filed in,
howling, stamping and grunting, holding out their dishes until
they were filled by the women of the house.</p>

<p>All this time they were careful to keep their faces averted
so that they would not be recognized. This is termed the
&ldquo;Tut&uacute;uk&rdquo; or &ldquo;going around.&rdquo; Returning to the k&aacute;sgi they
washed off their marks with urine, and sat down to feast on their
plunder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
The next day the men gathered again in the k&aacute;sgi and the
Aiy&aacute;guk or Asking Stick was constructed. It was made by a
man especially chosen for the purpose. It was a slender wand
about three feet long with three globes made of thin strips of
wood hanging by a strip of ok&#769;linok from the smaller end. It
was carried by the messenger between the men and women
during the feast, and was the visible sign of his authority. It
was treated with scrupulous respect by the Eskimo and to disregard
the wishes conveyed by means of it during the feast
would have been considered a lasting disgrace. When not in
use it was hung over the entrance to the k&aacute;sgi.</p>

<p>The wand maker, having finished the Asking Stick, took
his stand in the center of the room, and swaying the globes, to and
fro, asked the men to state their wishes. Then any man present
had the privilege of telling him of an article he wished and the
name of the woman from whom he wished it. (Among the
southern tribes the men made small wooden models of the
objects they wished which were hung on the end of the Asking
Stick.) The messenger then proceeded to the house of the woman
in question, swinging the globes in front of her, repeated the
wish and stood waiting for her answer. She in turn recollected
something that she desired and told it to the messenger. Thereupon
he returned to the k&aacute;sgi, and standing in front of the
first party, swung the globes, and told him what was desired
in return. In this way he made the round of the village. The
men then returned to their homes for the article desired, while
the messenger blackened his face with charcoal and donned a
costume betoking humility. This was considered the only
proper attitude in presenting gifts. The costume consisted of
wornout clothing, of which a disreputable raincoat (Kamle&iacute;ka)
and a dogskin belt with the tail behind were indispensable parts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Then the men and women gathered in the k&aacute;sgi where the
exchanges were made through the messenger. If anyone did
not have the gift requested he was in honor bound to secure it
as soon as possible and present it to his partner. Those exchanging
gifts entered a relationship termed o&#299;l&oacute;g&#769;uk, and among the
northern tribes where the ancient forms persevere, they continued
to exchange presents throughout succeeding festivals.</p>

<p>After this exchange, a dance was performed by the women.
They stripped to the waist, and taking their places on the
i&#324;glak, went through a series of motions in unison. These varied
considerably in time and movement from the conventional
women&#8217;s dance.</p>

<p>According to custom at the conclusion of the dance any man
has the privilege of asking any unmarried woman through the
messenger, if he might share her bed that night. If favorably
inclined, she replies that he must bring a deerskin for bedding.
He procures the deerskin, and presents it to her, and after the
feast is over remains with her for the night.</p>

<p>Whether these temporary unions lead to permanent marriage
I was unable to find out. The gift of reindeer skin is very like
the suit of clothing given in betrothal and would furnish
material for the parka which the husband presents to his bride.
The fact that the privilege is limited to unmarried women might
be also urged in turn. As the system of exchanging wives was
formerly common among the Alaskan Eskimo, and as they distribute
their favors at will, it is rather remarkable that the married
women are not included, as in the licentious feasts recorded of
the Greenlanders.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
From talks with some of the older Eskimo
I am led to regard this as a relic of an ancient custom similar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to those which have been observed among many nations of
antiquity, in which a woman is open to violation at certain
feasts. This privilege is taken advantage of, and may become
a preliminary to marriage.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Bladder Feast</span></p>

<p>The Bladder Feast (Tca&uacute;iyuk) is held in December at the
full of the moon. The object of this feast is the propitiation of
the inua of the animals slain during the season past. These
are believed to reside in the bladders, which the Eskimo carefully
preserve. The ceremony consists in the purification of the
bladders by the flame of the wild parsnip (A&iacute;kituk). The
hunters are also required to pass through the flame. They
return the bladders then to the sea, where entering the bodies of
their kind, they are reborn and return again, bringing continued
success to the hunter.</p>

<p>The first three days are spent in preparation. They
thoroughly clean the k&aacute;sgi, particularly the ken&eacute;thluk or fireplace,
the recognized abode of all spirits visiting the k&aacute;sgi.
Then the men bring in their harvest of
bladders.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
They tie them by the necks in bunches of eight to the end of their spears.
These they thrust into the walls at the rear of the room leaving
ample room for the dancers to pass under the swaying bladders
in the rites of purification. Offerings of food and water are
made to the inua, and they are constantly attended. One old
man told me that they would be offended and take their departure
if left alone for a moment. Dogs, being unclean, are not
allowed to enter the k&aacute;sgi. Neither is anyone permitted to do
any work during the ceremony.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Meanwhile four men,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> especially chosen for the purpose,
scour the adjoining country for parsnip stalks. They bind these
into small bundles, and place them on top of the l&aacute;torak, the
outer vestibule to the entrance of the k&aacute;sgi. In the evening
they take these into the k&aacute;sgi, open the bundles and spread out
the stalks on the floor. Then each hunter takes a stalk, and they
unite in a song to the parsnip, the burden of which is a request
that the stalks may become dry and useful for purification.
The heat of the seal oil lamps soon dries them, and they are tied
into one large bundle. The third day the sheaf is opened, and
two bundles made. The larger one is for the use of the dancers;
the smaller is placed on a spear and stuck in front of the bladders.</p>

<p>The fourth day the bladders are taken down and painted.
A grayish mixture is used which is obtained by burning a few
parsnip stalks and mixing the ashes with oil. The designs are
the series of bands and dots grouped to represent the totems
of the hunters. When the paint is dry the bladders are returned
to their places.</p>

<p>In the evening the men gather again in the k&aacute;sgi, and the
dancers proceed to strip off every vestige of clothing. Snatching
a handful of stalks at the common pile they light them at the
lamps, and join in a wild dance about the room. The resinous
stalks shoot into flame with a frightful glare, lighting up the
naked bodies of the dancers, and dusky interior of the k&aacute;sgi.
Waving the flaming torches over their heads, leaping, jumping,
and screaming like madmen they rush around the room, thrusting
the flame among the bladders and then into the faces of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
hunters. When the mad scene is at its height, they seize one
another, and struggle toward the p&uacute;gyarok (entrance hole).
Here each is thrust down in succession until all the dancers have
passed through. I am informed that this is a pantomime
enactment, an indication to the inua it is time for them to
depart.</p>

<p>The next day a hole is made in the ice near the k&aacute;sgi, and
each hunter dips his spear in the water, and, running back to the
k&aacute;sgi, stirs up the bladders with it. The presence of the sea
water reminds the inua of their former home, and they make
ready to depart. The bladders are then tied into one large
bundle, and the people await the full moon.</p>

<p>At sunrise the morning after the full moon each hunter takes
his load of bladders, and filing out of the k&aacute;sgi starts for the
hole in the ice on a dead run. Arriving there, he tears off the
bladders one by one, and thrusts them under the water. This
signifies the return of the inua to the sea.</p>

<p>As the bladders float or sink success is prophesied for the
hunter by the shaman in attendance.</p>

<p>In the meantime the old men build a fire of driftwood on the
ice in front of the k&aacute;sgi. The small bundle of parsnip stalks
which stood in front of the bladders is brought out and thrown
on the fire, and as the stalks kindle to the flame, each hunter
utters a shout, takes a short run, and leaps through in turn.
This performance purifies the hunter of any matter offensive to
the inua, and concludes the ceremony.</p>

<p>During the Bladder Feast all intercourse between the
married men and their wives is tabooed. They are required
to sleep in the k&aacute;sgi with the bachelors. Neither is any girl
who has attained puberty (Wingikt&oacute;ak) allowed near the
bladders. She is unclean (W&aacute;hok).</p>


<p class="center">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Feasts to the Dead</span></p>

<p>The Eskimo idea of the life after death and the rationale
for their most important ritual, the Feast to the Dead, is nowhere
better illustrated than in a quaint tale current along the Yukon,
in which the heroine, prematurely buried during a trancelike
sleep, visited the Land of the Dead. She was rudely awakened
from her deathlike slumber by the spirit of her grandmother
shaking her and exclaiming, &ldquo;Wake up. Do not sleep the hours
away. You are dead!&rdquo; Arising from her grave box, the maiden
was conducted by her guide to the world beneath, where the
dead had their dwellings in large villages grouped according
to the localities from which they came. Even the animal
shades were not forgotten, but inhabited separate communities
in human shape.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
After some travel the girl found the village
allotted to her tribe, and was reclaimed by her departed relatives.
She was recognized by the totem marks on her clothing, which
in ancient times the Eskimo always wore. She found the
inmates of this region leading a pleasant but somewhat monotonous
life, free from hardships and from the sleet and cold of their
earthly existence. They returned to the upper world during
the feasts to the dead, when they received the spiritual essence
of the food and clothing offered to their namesakes<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> by relatives.
According to the generosity or stinginess of the feast givers
there was a feast or a famine in spirit land, and those who were
so unfortunate as to have no namesake, either through their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
own carelessness<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
or the neglect of the community,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> went hungry
and naked. This was the worst calamity that could befall an
Eskimo, hence the necessity of providing a namesake and of
regularly feeding and clothing the same, in the interest of the
beloved dead.</p>

<h2>THE ANNUAL FEAST, <ins class="unicode" title="the middle I is a combined macron and acute">AIL&#298;&#769;GI</ins></h2>


<p>The Annual Feast to the Dead is a temporary arrangement,
whereby the shades of those recently departed are sustained
until the advent of the Great Feast to the Dead. The essence
of the offerings of food and drink are supposed to satisfy the
wants of the dead until they can be properly honored in the
Great Festival. In the latter event the relative discharges all
his social obligations to the dead, and the ghost is furnished with
such an abundance that it can never want in the world below.</p>

<p>The makers of the feast (n&auml;&#769;skut) are the nearest relatives
of those who have died during the past year, together with those
villagers who have not yet given the greater festival. The day
before the festival the male mourners go to the village burial
ground and plant a newly made stake before the grave of their
relative. The stake is surmounted by a wooden model of a
spear, if the deceased be a man; or a wooden dish, if it be a
woman. The totem mark of the deceased is carved upon it.
In the north simple models of kayak paddles suffice. The sticks
are a notification to the spirits in the land of the dead that the
time for the festival is at hand. Accordingly they journey to
the grave boxes, where they wait, ready to enter the k&aacute;sgi at
the song of invocation. To light their way from the other world
lamps are brought into the k&aacute;sgi and set before their accustomed
places. When the invitation song arises they leave their graves
and take their places in the fireplace (Ken&eacute;thluk), where they
enjoy the songs and dances, and receive the offerings of their
relatives.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
The Annual Feast is celebrated after the Bladder Feast
during the December moon. By the Yukon tribes it is repeated
just before the opening of spring. During the day of the festival
a taboo is placed on all work in the village, particularly that done
with any sharp pointed tool which might wound some wandering
ghost and bring retribution on the people.</p>

<p>At midday the whole village gathers in the k&aacute;sgi, and the
ceremony begins. Soon the mourners enter bearing great bowls
of food and drink which they deposit in the doorway. Then
the chorus leader arises and begins the song of invitation accompanied
by the relatives of the dead. It is a long minor chant,
a constant reiteration of a few well worn phrases.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Tukomalra-&#257;-, tung l&iacute;k-a,</span>
        <span style="margin-left: 4.6em;">tis-k&aacute;-a a-a-yung-a-a-yung-a, etc.</span><br />
 Dead ones, next of kin,
        <span style="margin-left: 4.9em;">come hither,</span><br />
 T&uacute;ntum kom&uacute;ga thet&aacute;mtatuk,
        <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">m&oacute;qkapik thet&aacute;mtatuk moqs&uacute;lthka.</span><br />
 Reindeer meat we bring you,
        <span style="margin-left: 2.6em;">water we bring you for your thirst.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>When the song is completed the mourners arise, and going
to the food in the doorway set it on the planks over the fireplace,
after which they take a ladleful from each dish pouring it through
the cracks in the floor, and the essence of this offering supplies
the shades below with food until the next festival. The remainder
of the food is distributed among those present. When the feast
is over, the balance of the day is given over to songs and dances.
Then the spirits are sent back to their homes by the simple
expedient of stamping on the floor.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE GREAT FEAST, <ins class="unicode" title="the accented A is a combined macron and acute">A&Iacute;THUK&#256;&#769;TUKHTUK</ins></h2>


<p>After making offerings to his relative at the annual feast
the chief mourner begins saving up his skins, frozen meat, and
other delicacies prized by the Eskimo, until, in the course of
years, he has accumulated an enormous amount of food and
clothing. Then he is prepared to give the great feast in honor
of his kinsman. Others in the village, who are bereaved, have
been doing the same thing. They meet and agree on a certain
time to celebrate the feast together during the ensuing year.
The time chosen is usually in January after the local feasts are
over, and visitors from neighboring tribes are free to attend.
There are no set intervals between these feasts as has been
generally supposed. They are celebrated at irregular intervals
according to the convenience of the givers.</p>

<p>At the minor festival preceding the Great Feast, the usual
invitation stakes planted before the dead are supplemented by
others placed before the graves of those in whose honor the
festival is to be given. On these is a painted model of the totemic
animals of the deceased. The feast giver sings an especial song
of invitation, requesting the dead kinsman to be present at the
approaching feast.</p>

<p>On the first day of the Great Feast the villagers welcome
the guests. Early in the morning they begin to arrive. The
messenger goes out on the ice and leads them into the village,
showing each where to tie his team. During the first day
the guests are fed in the k&aacute;sgi. They have the privilege of
demanding any delicacy they wish. After this they are
quartered on various homes in the village. Salmon or meat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
must also be provided for their dogs. This is no small item,
and often taxes the resources of a village to the utmost. I have
known of a village so poor after a period of prolonged hospitality
that it was reduced to starvation rations for the rest of the
winter.</p>

<p>Immediately on tying up their dogs, the guests go to the
k&aacute;sgi. On entering each one cries in set phraseology,
&ldquo;Ah-ka-k&aacute;&nbsp;P&iacute;atin,
Pikey&uacute;tum.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, ho! Look here! A trifling
present.&rdquo; He throws his present on a common pile in front of
the headman, who distributes them among the villagers. It is
customary to make the presents appear as large as possible.
One fellow has a bolt of calico which he unwinds through the
entrance hole, making a great display. It may be thirty yards
long. Sometimes they accompany the gift with a short dance.
It is considered bad form for one coming from a
distance<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
not to make the usual present, as in this way he purchases the right to
join in the festival dances.</p>

<p>As soon as all are gathered in the k&aacute;sgi, a feast is brought
in for the tired travelers. Kantags of sealmeat, the blackskin
of the bowhead, salmon berries swimming in oil, greens from the
hillsides, and pot after pot of tea take off the edge of hunger.
After gorging themselves, the guests seem incapable of further
exertion, and the remainder of the day is spent in visiting.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Feast Givers</span></p>

<p>The feast givers or n&auml;&#769;skut assemble in the k&aacute;sgi the second
day, and the ceremony proper begins. They range themselves
around the p&uacute;gyarok or entrance, the chorus and guests occupying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the back of the room and the spectators packing themselves
against the walls.</p>

<p>Each feast giver is garbed according to the sex of his dead
relative, not his own, so that some men wear women&#8217;s clothes
and vice versa. Each bears in his right hand a wand about two feet long
(Kel&eacute;zruk).<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
This is a small stick of wood surmounted
with tufts of down from ptarmigan (Okozreg&eacute;wik). All are
dressed to represent the totem to which the deceased belongs.
One wears a fillet and armlet of wolfskin (Eg&oacute;alik); others wear
armlets of ermine (T&aacute;reak); still others are crowned with
feathers of the raven (Tul&uacute;a) or the hawk
(Tciaka&uacute;ret).<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
After a short dance they withdraw and the day&#8217;s ceremony is finished.</p>

<p>The following day the n&auml;&#769;skut assemble again, but they have
doffed their fine feathers, and are dressed in their oldest clothes.
The suits of the day before they carry in a grass sack. They wear
raincoats of sealgut tied about the waist with a belt of dogskin,
and enter the k&aacute;sgi with eyes cast on the floor. Even in the
dances they keep their faces from the audience.</p>

<p>This attitude of humility is in accord with Eskimo ethics.
They say that if they adopt a boastful air and fail to give as
many presents as the other n&auml;&#769;skut they will be ashamed. So
they safeguard themselves in advance.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ritual</span></p>

<p>Advancing with downcast eyes, the n&auml;&#769;skut creep softly
across the k&aacute;sgi and take their places before the funeral lamps.
Then taking out their festival garments, they slip them on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Immediately the drummers start tapping lightly on their drums,
and at a signal from their leader the song of invitation begins.
Each n&auml;&#769;skuk advances in turn, invoking the presence of his dead
in a sad minor strain.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 Toak&oacute;ra &iacute;lyuga tak&iacute;na<br />
 Dead brother, come hither<br />
 A-yunga-ayunga-a-yunga.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">Or:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 Nule&aacute;ga aw&uacute;nga toak&oacute;ra<br />
 Sister mine, dead one,<br />
 Tak&iacute;na, n&uacute;leaga, tak&iacute;na,<br />
 Come hither, sister, come hither.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">Or:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 Ak&aacute;ga aw&uacute;nga tak&iacute;na<br />
 Mother mine, come hither.<br />
 Nan&aacute;ktuk, tak&iacute;na,<br />
 We wait for you, come hither.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">To which the chorus answer:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 Ily&uacute;ga aw&uacute;nga tak&iacute;na,<br />
 Our brother, come hither,<br />
 Takin&aacute;ka, ily&uacute;ga, tak&iacute;naka,<br />
 Return, dead brother, return.</p>

<p>The women advance in line, holding their wands in the
right hand, and singing in unison; then the men advance in their
turn, then both n&auml;&#769;skut and chorus sing together:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 Takinaka, aw&uacute;nga, tungalika,<br />
 Return to us, our dead kinsmen,<br />
 Nanak&aacute;tuk, kine&aacute;ktuk <ins class="unicode" title="the &iacute; also has a macron below it">tungal&iacute;ka</ins><br />
 We wait your home coming, our dead kinsmen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Suddenly the drummers cease and rap sharply on the ing&#769;lak
with their drumsticks. The dancers stop in the midst of their
movements and stamp on the floor, first with one foot then with
the other, placing their hands on their shoulders, bringing them
down over their bodies as though wiping off some unseen thing.
Then they slap their thighs and sit down. I am informed that
this is to &ldquo;wipe off&rdquo; any uncleanness (wahok) that might offend
the shades of the dead.</p>

<p>Then the namesakes of the dead troop into the k&aacute;sgi, and
take their places in the center of the room between the two lines.
To each, the n&auml;&#769;skuk hands a bowl of water and a kantag of
frozen reindeer meat cut into small pieces. The namesakes
drop a small portion of the meat on the floor. The essence is
evidently thought to pass below to the waiting inua. Then
they finish the remainder. At the same time a large amount of
frozen meat and fish is brought in and distributed among the
guests. This is done at the end of each day.</p>

<p>The fourth day the chorus leader mounts the top of the
k&aacute;sgi and begins again the invitation song. The people scatter
to the burying ground or to the ice along the shore according to the
spot where they have lain their dead. They dance among the
grave boxes so that the shades who have returned to them, when
not in the k&aacute;sgi, may see that they are doing them honor.</p>

<p>During the dancing the children of the village gather in
the k&aacute;sgi, carrying little kantags and sealskin sacks. The
women on returning bring great bags of frozen blueberries and
reindeer fat, commonly called &ldquo;Eskimo Ice Cream,&rdquo; with which
they fill the bowls of the children, but the young rogues
immediately slip their portions into their sacks (p&oacute;ksrut)
and hold out their dishes for more, crying in a deafening
chorus, &ldquo;Wunga-T&#363;&#769;k&rdquo; (Me too). This part of the festival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
is thoroughly enjoyed by the Eskimo, who idolize their
children.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the day&#8217;s feast many presents are given
away by the n&auml;&#769;skut, the husbands of the female feast givers
distributing them for the ladies, who assume a bashful air.
During the distribution the n&auml;&#769;skut maintain their deprecatory
attitude and pass disparaging remarks on their gifts. Sometimes
the presents are attached to a long line of &oacute;klinok (seal
thong) which the n&auml;&#769;skut haul down through the smokehole,
making the line appear as long as possible. At the same time
they sing in a mournful key bewailing their relative:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">
 Ah-ka-&nbsp;ily&uacute;ga toak&oacute;ra, t&aacute;kin,<br />
 Oh! oh! dead brother, return,<br />
 Utiktut&aacute;tuk, ily&uacute;ga aw&uacute;nga,<br />
 Return to us, our brother,<br />
 Illear&uacute;qtutuk, ily&uacute;ga,<br />
 We miss you, dear brother,<br />
 Pikey&uacute;tum, kok&iacute;tutuk,<br />
 A trifling present we bring you.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Clothing of the Namesakes</span></p>

<p>The following day occurs the clothing of the namesakes.
This is symbolical of clothing the dead, who ascend into the
bodies of their namesakes during the ceremony and take on the
spiritual counterpart of the clothing.</p>

<p>After a grand distribution of presents by the n&auml;&#769;skut,
bags of fine clothing are lowered to the feast givers and the
namesakes take the center of the floor, in front of their
relatives, the feast givers. Then each n&auml;&#769;skuk calls out to the
particular namesake of his dead kinsman: &ldquo;&#298;tak&iacute;n, illorahug-n&aacute;ka,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come hither, my beloved,&rdquo; and proceeds to remove
the clothing of the namesake and put on an entirely new suit of
mukluks, trousers, and parka, made of the finest furs. Then the
feast giver gathers up the discarded clothing, and stamps
vigorously on the floor, bidding the ghost begone to its resting
place. It goes, well satisfied, and the dancers disperse until
another great festival. Until the feast is concluded no one can
leave the village.</p>

<h2>THE INVITING-IN FESTIVAL</h2>


<p>The Inviting-In Festival (Aith&uacute;kaguk) is a great inter-tribal
feast, second in importance to the Great Feast to the Dead.
It is a celebration on invitation from one tribe to her neighbors
when sufficient provisions have been collected. It takes place
late in the season, after the other festivals are over. Neighboring
tribes act as hosts in rotation, each striving to outdo the
other in the quality and quantity of entertainment offered.
During this festival the dramatic pantomime dances for which
the Alaskan Eskimo are justly famous, are performed by
especially trained actors. For several days the dances continue,
each side paying the forfeit as they lose in the dancing
contests. In this respect the representations are somewhat
similar to the nith contests of the Greenlanders. As I have
noticed the dances at length
elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
I shall only give a brief
survey here, sufficient to show their place in the Eskimo festival
dances.</p>

<p>The main dances of the Inviting-In Festival are totemic
in character, performed by trained actors to appease the totems
of the hunters, and insure success for the coming season. These
are danced in pantomime and depict the life of arctic animals,
the walrus, raven, bear, ptarmigan, and others. Then there are
group dances which illustrate hunting scenes, like the Reindeer
and Wolf Pack dance already described, also dances of a purely
comic character, designed for the entertainment of the guests.
During the latter performances the side which laughs has to pay
a forfeit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Elaborate masks are worn in all of the dances. The full
paraphernalia, masks, handmasks, fillets, and armlets, are worn
by the chief actors. They are supported by richly garbed
assistants. An old shaman acts as master of ceremonies. There
is an interchange of presents between the tribes during the
intervals but not between individuals, as in the Asking Festival.
At the close of the festival the masks are burned.</p>

hands through the air in graceful unison. It is a difference between rude vigor and dramatic
art.</p></div>

barrel are used. The liquid is fermented with sour dough and allowed to distill through the
barrel. The Eskimo had no liquor prior to the advent of the whalers, who supplied them with the
materials and probably taught them the art of distilling. The U. S. Revenue Cutter &ldquo;Bear&rdquo;
has been active in breaking up the practice. In 1909, six illicit stills were seized on the Diomede
